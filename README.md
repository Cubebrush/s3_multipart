# S3 Multipart

The S3 Multipart gem brings direct multipart (chunked) uploading to S3 to Rails.

Multipart uploading allows files to be split into many chunks and uploaded in parallel or succession (or both). This can result in dramatically increased upload speeds for the client and allows for the pausing and resuming of uploads. For a more complete overview of multipart uploading as it applies to S3, see the overview [here](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html).
