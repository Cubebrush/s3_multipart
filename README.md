# CarrierWave Multipart

CarrierWave Multipart brings direct multipart (chunked) uploading to CarrierWave. It
is built upon both [CarrierWave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) and
[CarrierWaveDirect](https://github.com/dwilkie/carrierwave_direct) and currently supports Amazon S3.

Multipart uploading allows files to be split into many chunks and uploaded in parallel or succession (or both). This can result in dramatically increased upload speeds for the client and allows for the pausing and resuming of uploads. For a more complete overview of multipart uploading as it applies to S3, see the overview [here](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html).
